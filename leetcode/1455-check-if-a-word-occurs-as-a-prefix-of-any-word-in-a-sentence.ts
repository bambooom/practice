// Given a sentence that consists of some words separated by a single space, and a searchWord, check if searchWord is a prefix of any word in sentence.
// Return the index of the word in sentence (1-indexed) where searchWord is a prefix of this word. If searchWord is a prefix of more than one word, return the index of the first word (minimum index). If there is no such word return -1.
// A prefix of a string s is any leading contiguous substring of s.

// Example 1:
// Input: sentence = "i love eating burger", searchWord = "burg"
// Output: 4
// Explanation: "burg" is prefix of "burger" which is the 4th word in the sentence.
// Example 2:
// Input: sentence = "this problem is an easy problem", searchWord = "pro"
// Output: 2
// Explanation: "pro" is prefix of "problem" which is the 2nd and the 6th word in the sentence, but we return 2 as it's the minimal index.
// Example 3:
// Input: sentence = "i am tired", searchWord = "you"
// Output: -1
// Explanation: "you" is not a prefix of any word in the sentence.

function isPrefixOfWord(sentence: string, searchWord: string): number {
  const words = sentence.split(' ');

  for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
    if (words[i].startsWith(searchWord)) {
      return i + 1;
    }
  }

  return -1;
